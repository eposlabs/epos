# What is Epos?

Epos is an opinionated engine that simplifies browser extension development. Epos supports any Chromium-based browsers: Chrome, Edge, Brave and others. Firefox and Safari are not supported.

Compared to other extension frameworks like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) or [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/), Epos takes a more opinionated approach and offers higher-level abstractions with minimalistic APIs.

## Technology Stack

Epos is designed to work seamlessly with [React](https://react.dev). For state management, it relies on [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) under the hood providing higher-level abstractions, so you don’t need to learn MobX directly. For data synchronization across extension contexts (popup, side panel, background, tabs), Epos uses [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/), which automatically handles conflict resolution.

You can opt out of these technologies, but doing so means giving up some of Epos’s benefits.

## How to Install

Epos is not provided as an NPM package, instead, Epos itself is an extension which you install from the official [Chrome Web Store page](https://get.epos.dev). Then you link your project’s directory to the Epos extension and Epos will run your code in the browser. Epos can run any number of projects simultaneously.

When you are finished with the development, you can click **[export]** button inside Epos interface and your project will be exported as a standard browser extension which you can publish to the Chrome Web Store.

## Why Not an NPM Package?

It is technically not possible to achieve the same level of development experience with just an NPM package. Epos sets up service worker, content script, offscreen page, injects your code to tabs and iframes, manages data synchronization & persistence and much more. All of these can’t be done with just `npm install`, it requires a whole set of prerequisites which Epos extension provides out of the box with zero configuration.
