# Getting Started

## Your First Project

First, you need to install Epos from [Chrome Web Store](https://get.epos.dev). After installation, open `https://epos.dev/@devkit`, a built-in development environment which allows you to connect your projects to Epos.

```
üìÅ my-project
  üìÑ epos.json
```

To get started, we need to connect our project to Epos. For this, let's first create a new folder, for example `my-project`, and inside this folder, create a `epos.json` file. This file is the main configuration file for your project and it will also be referred to as _project spec_. Let's start with a minimal configuration:

::: code-group

```json [epos.json]
{
  "name": "my-project"
}
```

:::

Name should be lowercased and contain only letters, digits and hyphens.

Now we are ready to connect this project to Epos extension. Go back to `https://epos.dev/@devkit`, click on the **Add Project** button, and select `my-project` folder.

After selecting the folder, Epos will read `epos.json` file and connect project to Epos. Any changes you make inside `my-project` will be automatically picked up by Epos. Do not close `https://epos.dev/@devkit` tab, as it is required for Epos to work.

::: details How does it work?

Epos uses File System Access API. This API is currently supported only in Chromium-based browsers. When you select a folder, Epos extension gets access to this folder and all its contents. Epos will keep this access as long as `https://epos.dev/@devkit` tab is open.

:::

For now, our project does nothing. Let's add some functionality to it.

Epos rethinks extension development process and setup. Instead of defining `manifest.json` and configuring Service Worker, popup and other pages, Epos takes this approach: you tell epos what css and js code to load and where. All configuration is done inside `epos.json` file.

So let's create `script.js` file inside `my-project` folder:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html {3}
üìÅ my-project
  üìÑ epos.json
  üìÑ script.js
```

**script.js:**

```js
console.log('Hello from Epos!')
```

Let's load this js file on example.com website. For this, we need to update `epos.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "matches": "https://example.com/", // [!code ++]
  "load": "script.js" // [!code ++]
}
```

You do not need to refresh or reload anything, Epos devkit (assuming you have it open) will automatically pick up any changes. Now navigate to `https://example.com/`, open DevTools and you should see `Hello from Epos!` message in the console.

If you update `script.js` file, for example change the message, you will see new message after tab refresh. If you want tab to be reloaded automatically, simply add `?reload` to the url, like this: `https://example.com/?reload`. Epos will automatically reload the tab when you make changes to your project files.
