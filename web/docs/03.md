# About

Epos rethinks extension development process and setup. Instead of defining `manifest.json` and configuring Service Worker, popup and other pages, Epos takes this approach: you tell epos what css and js code to load and where. All configuration is done inside `epos.json` file, also referred as _project spec_. In this spec you describe your project.

The minimal epos.json file looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project"
}
```

Name should be lowercased and contain only letters, digits and hyphens.
